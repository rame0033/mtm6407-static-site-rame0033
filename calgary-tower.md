  <h2>About Calgary Tower</h2>
  <p>A defining feature of the cityâ€™s skyline, the Calgary Tower offers breathtaking 360-degree views of downtown Calgary, the Rocky Mountains, and the vast Alberta prairies. Standing 191 meters (626 feet) tall, this iconic landmark provides a unique perspective of the city, especially from its glass-floored observation deck, where visitors can look straight down to the streets below. The tower is also home to Sky 360, a revolving restaurant that offers fine dining with stunning panoramic views. </p>
